[So we are officially a couple now](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0EoAl1ECVSSWuwr6/giphy.gif). Why do you ask? Because we got in an argument about the silliest thing today. It was about overusing the diswasher for smallest number of dishes. My family does not use dishwashers. Yue, on the other hand, typically uses dishwasher pretty frequently. So we ended up fighting about how Yue was not able to handle any difficulties in life and would choose the more comforting option, even if it costs her money. I honestly don’t think the whole issue was worth fighting about, but that’s what fights are typically about: trivial things. In the end, I felt pretty bad for the whole encounter. Lesson learned. Moving on.
