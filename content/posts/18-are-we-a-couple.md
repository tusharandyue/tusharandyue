I have been spending a lot of time at Yueâ€™s place now. Itâ€™s almost like we are living together. I have to say, I really love living with her. I would not mind doing this for the rest of my life with her. The best part of this is that she told me today she felt like we were a couple. [Awww](https://media.giphy.com/media/YKcWT7DvtwVVu/giphy.gif) ðŸ˜€
