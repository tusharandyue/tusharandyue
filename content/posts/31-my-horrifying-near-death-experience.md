“I did something super awesome!” - Tushar

“Oh really? Oh let me guess… you managed to overcome your fear of bugs and now you are no longer scared of bugs. Is that correct big man?” - Diary

“OMG STOP JUDGING ME! THE BUG LOOKED REALLY FREAKING SCARY!!!!!” - Tushar [\**cries internally*\*](https://media.giphy.com/media/gkLhGv1yNEYFlf49qO/giphy.gif)

But really, the last few days have been pretty awesome for me because I got to go on a vacation with Yue. She is a trooper. She organized the whole vacation for me and I LOVED every single moment of it. Yes, even when I couldn’t swim in the super cold water. Yue and I kayaked and paddle boarded. [Paddle boarding](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdVarbhugUBQOeA/giphy.gif) was super scary even with a life jacket because the river was suuuuuuper deep. We went to a super nice restaurant (where a scary looking bug landed on my plate and I got freaked out while Yue handled it like a pro and make me look like a [bitch](https://media.giphy.com/media/HtYsYjPsw1nVu/giphy.gif) in front of everyone else) and saw a family of deer. We ate some ice cream and cheesecake too! I am sure I am forgetting a few [wisps](https://media.giphy.com/media/DOotiImlZCPQs/giphy.gif) of details that will congeal in a [pool](https://media.giphy.com/media/Q0CqYAAi7DEqs/giphy.gif) somewhere. The only downside was that our vacation was cut short because of some unforeseen circumstances and that is definitely not fair to Yue. So Yue, I hope you take this [gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/RWUqVYucDBD4A/giphy.gif) as my apology.
