So today is Yue’s [birthday](https://media.giphy.com/media/yoJC2GnSClbPOkV0eA/giphy.gif). We have talked about what to do during this weekend for a while now. Our day today was filled with lots and lots of activities that I, alone, would never do all of them in one week. So that’s saying something. We went to the arboretum and hiked there and shared a tender moment. [Well, a few tender moments](https://media.giphy.com/media/6UpQJVXTiOGuA/giphy.gif). We went to the mall too! Walking at the Galleria with Yue is so much fun! She is one of those people who likes trying new things and is really flexible, so I can easily go into any shop I want. For dinner, we went to 99 ranch too. And oh, we watched Black Panther. What a busy day!
