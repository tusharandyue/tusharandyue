So this is awkward. Today, I made Yue cry. I didn’t mean to… it just… sort of happened. It happened because I was pressuring Yue to call her doctor’s office to get results of her tests back. I find that Yue is opposite of millenials - she never feels entitled to anything. I, on the other hand, want things done in a timely fashion, and I get a little flustered if other people aren’t doing their job right (yeah, I know, I would be a horrible boss). So anyways, long story short, I wanted her to stand up for herself, but I was too aggressive. That made her feel uncomfortable and she started crying.
