Today, we went to see Rodeo with Pressida. It was a lot of fun; too loud and too extreme, just like the people watching it ðŸ˜€. But the most important part of today was the fact that I cooked [steak](https://media.giphy.com/media/t8t3VPvJEBVxC/giphy.gif) for her. I have been watching a lot of videos on youtube about how to cook steak, and today was the day I tried all of that out. We went to my place (yes, I cooked steak in my placeâ€¦), and I cooked a rather below average and well done steak. I tried a little piece of it, and I wasnâ€™t impressed by it. But Yue thought it was pretty good. She got so excited that she shared the pics with Ting and Ruixue. I am just glad I was able to make her happy!
