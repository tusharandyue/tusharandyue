So this is my very first attempt at keeping a journal. I am pretty sure this is going to be a pretty rough journal. Not sure how long I can keep this going, but I am going to try to log something interesting about us in here. Plan is to make this into a website and surprise Yue. And [I am no good with words](https://media.giphy.com/media/A3t48v7vgzk1G/giphy.gif), so Yue, this is an apology in advance. 

Today, I found out Yue was keeping a journal. I am totally surprised. I love her even more. I had an idea that was similar to hers - makes me think we are so much compatible!
