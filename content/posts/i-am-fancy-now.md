Today I went my first official fancy ballet dressed super [fancy](https://media.giphy.com/media/LOy47Su8Mx7uE/giphy.gif) (with whatever clothes I have in my closet). The ballet was performed in a gorgeous building with giant sculptures inside of it. The whole ceiling was shiny and our seats were REALLY high to the point that I was legitimately afraid I was going to fall. Thank God for Yue - she told me to don’t be a pussy, and be a man (I may or may not have made that part up). The ballet was easy to follow most of the times and it helped me tremendously that Yue was explaining me a lot of the things. The guide I read before the show began was nicely designed too. I am really really glad that Yue took the initiative to take me to the ballet. I am sure she loved the whole experience too. I just wish I was a bit richer to do this more often and wear a [suit](https://media.giphy.com/media/nADclROyPirtK/giphy.gif).

ps. I wanted to bring [Yoda](https://media.giphy.com/media/1yIOP7uri46SQ/giphy.gif) to the ballet. But it would lead to a [disaster](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdvdkSja6nXmOoqA/giphy.gif)!

pps. I was [disappointed](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oAt21Fnr4i54uK8vK/giphy.gif) that the ballet dancers weren’t covered in [gold leaf](https://media.giphy.com/media/K15sV0WWFUE9y/giphy.gif). [I want my money back!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o75225lIkdm2SvSco/giphy.gif)
