Lovely weather. Lovelier company all day from Yue. It was a very relaxing and focused study session, right after a bit of fun ðŸ˜€. Yoda behaved nicely and I can tell Yue really appreciates me training him. Well she told me that directly, so [I am no Sherlock](https://media.giphy.com/media/TtjTmZWrQ4EM/giphy.gif). And oh, we passed CMD and that's a cause for celebration. Term is almost over. Yue's birthday is almost here. Never have I been looking forward to break than this term.
