Yue’s [birthday](https://media.giphy.com/media/xThuWkj1FAYH4wmGfC/giphy.gif) celebration continues today. I am not going to lie, this is quite possibly the best weekend I have ever had. And it’s all made possible by Yue. We went to Galveston beach, parked my car illegally on the sand while worrying heavily about whether my tiny little Civic would be able to get out of the sand. It did… so that’s a good news! [I love Honda](https://media.giphy.com/media/BdUFU1x33ugla/giphy.gif). And btw, this was my very first visit to an actual beach. [LIKE A REAL FREAKING BEACH WITH LOTS OF BLUE STUFF](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdv7Nd456OCovaaA/giphy.gif)! I was quite excited. Yue took some videos of me acting like a fool. I am glad she did that. We had some lunch at Gypsey Joynt. It was a pretty nice place with pretty nice food. And while making our way back, we decided to visit Zone D'Erotica. It was a pretty bad store. We made some jokes here and there, but most of the time, I was thinking about the finances of this store (how did this store make any money??). What surprised me the most was the fact that Yue was super adventurous. She was completely OK with visiting this place. I would have never imagined her doing that.
