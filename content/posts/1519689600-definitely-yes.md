Oh boy. This day... This day was pretty much the same as yesterday, with me freaking out, and Yue working her [magic](https://media.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif) on me. Would I have survived PA school without her? Definitely yes. Would I also experience crippling anxiety, GERD, and PUD? Definitely yes. The good thing is that the hard tests are behind us, and yes, we are preparing for the possibility of remediating the anatomy course. [Side note, she is a great patient to do a physical exam](https://media.giphy.com/media/6UpQJVXTiOGuA/giphy.gif). Very detail oriented. And she gets a little jealous of me hanging out with Pressida. Just a bit, which makes me want Yue even more... ðŸ˜€
