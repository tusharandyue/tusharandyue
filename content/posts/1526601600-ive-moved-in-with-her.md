I have been living with Yue for about a month now at her place. Our school vacation started on the 14th and since then we have been having a lot of fun! We went to Crystal Beach and [took Yoda to the vet](https://media.giphy.com/media/5LU6ZcEGBbhVS/giphy.gif). We shopped around for a new phone at the Verizon store and Yue got a brand new phone!!! Unfortunately, I had a fight with my parents about Yue. I will spare you the details, because I donâ€™t want this diary to have anything to do with my overall relationship status. Needless to say, things are going to be rocky for a while. I may take a break from writing in this diary. I may come back.
