Yue and I spent this weekend celebrating [Valentine’s Day](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o752obYVRjAcJ4vsc/giphy.gif). I cooked up some pasta and some dessert that I was pretty proud of. The best part of the whole night was when Yue presented me with a very moving note on the back of a photo collage she made. I wasn’t surprised at all. [That’s why I love her.](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2tmyH06o86kLqU/giphy.gif)

I want to say, I am VERY happy when I am with Yue. Recently, we have been trying out a sort of new schedule that gives me more time to spend at home on the weekends so I can finish my tasks before the week officially begins. I like that change. It allows me to focus on important things like studying and going to gym rather than things like ironing or meal prep during weekdays.

I also got into a small car accident right near Yue’s apartment. When I told her this, she came rushing out and spent some time with me. [I AM SO GLAD SHE IS WITH ME!](https://media.giphy.com/media/l49JFIqAYshRSD6tq/giphy.gif)

ps. I am so sorry that I was an hour late to the Lunar New Year celebration event. [Plz forgive.](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc1ffY03hnhRUyUU/giphy.gif)

pps. It has been a full year since I started keeping this journal. [Yay me!](https://media.giphy.com/media/8PBfNDoySmsRc49P4F/giphy.gif)
