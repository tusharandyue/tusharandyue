Today was a good day. Started out very stressful with waking up super early in the morning to cram for a test, but it ended with [some nice relaxing time with Yue](https://media.giphy.com/media/5CGHc2q51s3AI/giphy.gif). With the pressure of the finals, I forgot how it felt like to take the time for some of the little things.
