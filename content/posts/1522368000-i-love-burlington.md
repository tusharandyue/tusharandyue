Today, Yue and I  went shopping at Burlington coat factory and I loved it! I hope Yue loved it too, but we havenâ€™t developed telepathic mind-melding communication yet. We ended up buying a lot of [clothes](https://media.giphy.com/media/hnl83xVQxpqJG/giphy.gif). Yue helped me pick out some shirts and pants, and I gotta say, she has a good sense of fashion. I like shopping with her.
