So Yue got back to Houston earlier than expected: on the NYE at 11pm. That meant we spent the NYE together… inside the apartment… eating some leftover food that I made. I was very happy to do that because I got to do it with Yue. TBH, I was very surprised when Yue told me that her flight was moved up and I excited the whole day! We shared a midnight kiss, and watched the 1st episode of [This Is Us](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Iy4vh0fIqMXTgu4/giphy.gif). 

Yoda on the other hand, is acting a little sluggish and I am noticing a red bump on his left [foot?hand?](https://media.giphy.com/media/GxN4ics7OlvsA/giphy.gif) I think it’s infected. Yue is going to take him to the vet and hopefully get some antibiotics. And oh, almost forgot, I did the whole surprise thing to Yue and she [OBVIOUSLY started crying](https://media.giphy.com/media/11Un64tF2yX8JO/giphy.gif) .
