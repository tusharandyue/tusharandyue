  <p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/kFku8NDzYI9ZU26QXJ/giphy.gif">Hi bud</a>, how long has it been? Like 7 freaking months! Well, I have been a little busy, but mostly I just forgot about writing in you. Basically, Yue and I broke up for a while, but then we got back together. That‚Äôs a super short summary of what happened that you are privy to. The reason I am writing this very special entry here is because I am finally done with the website I am making for Yue. She has no idea that I am doing anything remotely close to this. She is currently in Hawaii, while I am with my family finishing up this little project that took FAR TOO LONG for me to finish. Funny thing is that while she has been sending these really amazing, well-crafted (love) letters, I have been responding with ‚ÄúK,‚Äù and basically saying ‚ÄúI am no good with words.‚Äù Hopefully, this should surprise her. The plan is to write a letter, somehow explaining my love for her, and giving her the gift of this diary, and a key to my apartment. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/rXliavIYbs60o/giphy.gif">Wish me luck!</a></p>

  <p>I have been living with Yue for about a month now at her place. Our school vacation started on the 14th and since then we have been having a lot of fun! We went to Crystal Beach and <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/5LU6ZcEGBbhVS/giphy.gif">took Yoda to the vet</a>. We shopped around for a new phone at the Verizon store and Yue got a brand new phone!!! Unfortunately, I had a fight with my parents about Yue. I will spare you the details, because I don‚Äôt want this diary to have anything to do with my overall relationship status. Needless to say, things are going to be rocky for a while. I may take a break from writing in this diary. I may come back.</p>

  <p>So today I found out that Yoda can sleep in bed with Yue‚Ä¶ if he feels like it‚Ä¶ Basically this little shithead annoys the crap out of me when we try to take a nap. He runs around and makes a lot of noise. Little shithead thinks it‚Äôs so much fun to play with the blinds when his parents are trying to sleep. I am sure he enjoys annoying us. We are the most important people in his life: we feed him, clean up after his shit and vomit, take him to the vet, give him medications, play with him, basically we serve his ass all day long. And do you know how he rewards us? BY NOT LETTING ME NAP WHEN I REALLY NEED TO NAP AND I ONLY HAVE LIKE 15 MINUTES TO NAP. But hey, if you are nice to him, and if he feels like it, he will cuddle with Yue and sleep in the bed and let me take a nap quietly. Thanks for nothing <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/iviU5Hwac8f04/giphy.gif">asshole</a>!</p>

  <p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0EoAl1ECVSSWuwr6/giphy.gif">So we are officially a couple now</a>. Why do you ask? Because we got in an argument about the silliest thing today. It was about overusing the diswasher for smallest number of dishes. My family does not use dishwashers. Yue, on the other hand, typically uses dishwasher pretty frequently. So we ended up fighting about how Yue was not able to handle any difficulties in life and would choose the more comforting option, even if it costs her money. I honestly don‚Äôt think the whole issue was worth fighting about, but that‚Äôs what fights are typically about: trivial things. In the end, I felt pretty bad for the whole encounter. Lesson learned. Moving on.</p>

  <p>I have been spending a lot of time at Yue‚Äôs place now. It‚Äôs almost like we are living together. I have to say, I really love living with her. I would not mind doing this for the rest of my life with her. The best part of this is that she told me today she felt like we were a couple. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/YKcWT7DvtwVVu/giphy.gif">Awww</a> üòÄ</p>

  <p>Today, Yue and I  went shopping at Burlington coat factory and I loved it! I hope Yue loved it too, but we haven‚Äôt developed telepathic mind-melding communication yet. We ended up buying a lot of <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/hnl83xVQxpqJG/giphy.gif">clothes</a>. Yue helped me pick out some shirts and pants, and I gotta say, she has a good sense of fashion. I like shopping with her.</p>

  <p>OK, so I made her cry again. What a fool! I honestly didn‚Äôt mean to, but it just happened. I was joking around too much this time. Rather than going into too many details, all I am going to say is that I need to be mindful of her limits. I feel pretty crummy.</p>

  <p>So this is awkward. Today, I made Yue cry. I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Ä¶ it just‚Ä¶ sort of happened. It happened because I was pressuring Yue to call her doctor‚Äôs office to get results of her tests back. made Yue cry bc i was pressuring her to call the doctor&rsquo;s office to get the test results. I find that Yue is opposite of millenials - she never feels entitled to anything. I, on the other hand, want things done in a timely fashion, and I get a little flustered if other people aren‚Äôt doing their job right (yeah, I know, I would be a horrible boss). So anyways, long story short, I wanted her to stand up for herself, but I was too aggressive. That made her feel uncomfortable and she started crying.</p>

  <p>Today, we went to see Rodeo with Pressida. It was a lot of fun; too loud and too extreme, just like the people watching it üòÄ. But the most important part of today was the fact that I cooked <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/t8t3VPvJEBVxC/giphy.gif">steak</a> for her. I have been watching a lot of videos on youtube about how to cook steak, and today was the day I tried all of that out. We went to my place (yes, I cooked steak in my place‚Ä¶), and I cooked a rather below average and well done steak. I tried a little piece of it, and I wasn‚Äôt impressed by it. But Yue thought it was pretty good. She got so excited that she shared the pics with Ting and Ruixue. I am just glad I was able to make her happy!</p>

  <p>Yue‚Äôs <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/xThuWkj1FAYH4wmGfC/giphy.gif">birthday</a> celebration continues today. I am not going to lie, this is quite possibly the best weekend I have ever had. And it‚Äôs all made possible by Yue. We went to Galveston beach, parked my car illegally on the sand while worrying heavily about whether my tiny little Civic would be able to get out of the sand. It did‚Ä¶ so that‚Äôs a good news! <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/BdUFU1x33ugla/giphy.gif">I love Honda</a>. And btw, this was my very first visit to an actual beach. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdv7Nd456OCovaaA/giphy.gif">LIKE A REAL FREAKING BEACH WITH LOTS OF BLUE STUFF</a>! I was quite excited. Yue took some videos of me acting like a fool. I am glad she did that. We had some lunch at Gypsey Joynt. It was a pretty nice place with pretty nice food. And while making our way back, we decided to visit Zone D&rsquo;Erotica. It was a pretty bad store. We made some jokes here and there, but most of the time, I was thinking about the finances of this store (how did this store make any money??). What surprised me the most was the fact that Yue was super adventurous. She was completely OK with visiting this place. I would have never imagined her doing that. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/5p2wQFyu8GsFO/giphy.gif">Never have I been glad to be wrong.</a></p>

  <p>So today is Yue‚Äôs <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/yoJC2GnSClbPOkV0eA/giphy.gif">birthday</a>. We have talked about what to do during this weekend for a while now. Our day today was filled with lots and lots of activities that I, alone, would never do all of them in one week. So that‚Äôs saying something. We went to the arboretum and hiked there and shared a tender moment. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/6UpQJVXTiOGuA/giphy.gif">Well, a few tender moments</a>. We went to the mall too! Walking at the Galleria with Yue is so much fun! She is one of those people who likes trying new things and is really flexible, so I can easily go into any shop I want. For dinner, we went to 99 ranch too. And oh, we watched Black Panther. What a busy day!</p>

This day&hellip; This day was pretty much the same as yesterday, with me freaking out, and Yue working her <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif">magic</a> on me. Would I have survived PA school without her? Definitely yes. Would I also experience crippling anxiety, GERD, and PUD? Definitely yes. The good thing is that the hard tests are behind us, and yes, we are preparing for the possibility of remediating the anatomy course. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/6UpQJVXTiOGuA/giphy.gif">Side note, she is a great patient to do a physical exam</a>. Very detail oriented. And she gets a little jealous of me hanging out with Pressida. Just a bit, which makes me want Yue even more&hellip; üòÄ</p>

I was so distraught after taking my tests today, but after spending some time with Yue, all of my worries just melted away. She is my natural anxiolytic!

  <p>So this is my very first attempt at keeping a journal. I am pretty sure this is going to be a pretty rough journal. Not sure how long I can keep this going, but I am going to try to log something interesting about us in here. Plan is to make this into a website and surprise Yue. And <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/A3t48v7vgzk1G/giphy.gif">I am no good with words</a>, so Yue, this is an apology in advance.</p>

<p>Today, I found out Yue was keeping a journal. I am totally surprised. I love her even more. I had an idea that was similar to hers - makes me think we are so much compatible!</p>
